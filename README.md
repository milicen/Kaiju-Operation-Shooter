**Game Concept :** 
A giant monster has appeared and has been causing a chaotic events in a countryside by the ocean.
A scientific lab has sent out a robot that will cross the ocean to the location in need of support.
Player controls an aircraft to escort and protect the mech from enemies that tries to stop us from killing the monster.
The scientists have equipped the player an experimental time-travel machine, which activates everytime the mech or the aircraft got destroyed.
This time travel machine will send the player (aircraft) to an alternate dimension (void) for a set period of time.
While in the void, player will slowly lose progress (going back to the past).
After some time, player will sent back to the real world with hp fully recovered (also applies to mech).

**Engine Used** : Godot 3.0

**Language** : C# & GDScript
